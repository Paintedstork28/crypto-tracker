PROJECT SUMMARY: Crypto Price Tracker & Arbitrage
===================================================

1. PROJECT CONCEPT
-------------------
A real-time cryptocurrency price tracker and stablecoin arbitrage detector. Tracks Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana prices and monitors USDT, USDC, DAI stablecoins across 20 global currencies to find profitable arbitrage opportunities. Built as a single static HTML file — no backend, no installation, runs entirely in the browser.

2. HOW IT WAS BUILT
--------------------
Tech stack:
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS and vanilla JavaScript
- No frameworks (no React, Vue, etc.) — pure browser-native code
- Client-side only — all logic runs in the user's browser
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds via setInterval

Architecture:
- index.html — light mode version
- crypto-tracker.html — dark mode version
- Fetches live prices from CoinGecko API
- Calculates arbitrage spreads, deducts realistic fees, shows net profit
- Responsive card-based layout with hover animations

Features:
- Live price cards for BTC, ETH, SOL with 24h change, market cap, 24h high
- Stablecoin tracking with peg status indicator (ON PEG / DEPEG)
- USD arbitrage detection — finds cheapest and most expensive stablecoin pair
- Multi-currency arbitrage leaderboard across 20 currencies, ranked by profitability
- Currency detail breakdown with local currency profit calculation
- Interactive profit calculator — input investment amount, see net profit after fees
- Realistic fee structure: buy 0.10%, swap 0.05%, sell 0.10%, network 0.02%, FX spread 0.03% (total 0.30%)

3. DATABASE STRUCTURE
---------------------
None — no database. All data is fetched live from APIs and processed in-browser. No data is stored.

4. DATA SOURCES
---------------
- CoinGecko API — live cryptocurrency prices, market data, multi-currency rates

5. APIs & COSTS
----------------
- CoinGecko Markets API — FREE, no API key needed
  URL: api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&ids={id}
  Used for: BTC, ETH, SOL prices, market cap, 24h change, 24h high

- CoinGecko Simple Price API — FREE, no API key needed
  URL: api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids={stableIds}&vs_currencies={currencyCodes}
  Used for: USDT, USDC, DAI prices across 20 currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CNY, INR, AUD, CAD, CHF, SGD, HKD, SEK, NOK, DKK, NZD, ZAR, BRL, MXN, KRW, THB)

- CORS Proxy fallback — FREE
  URL: corsproxy.io (used if direct CoinGecko calls fail due to CORS)

Total cost: $0 — all APIs are free with no key required.
Note: CoinGecko free tier has rate limits (~10-30 calls/min). If usage grows, paid plans start at $129/month.

6. DATA REFRESH
---------------
- Automatic every 30 seconds (client-side setInterval)
- No manual refresh needed — runs continuously while the page is open
- No cached/stored data — always live

7. DEPLOYMENT
-------------
- GitHub repo: hosted on GitHub (Paintedstork28 account)
- GitHub Pages: static HTML served via GitHub Pages for a shareable link
- Local: just open the HTML file in any browser

8. WHAT IT CAN BE USED FOR
---------------------------
- Real-time crypto price monitoring
- Identifying stablecoin arbitrage opportunities across global currencies
- Checking stablecoin peg status (is USDT/USDC/DAI holding its $1 peg?)
- Estimating arbitrage profits with realistic fee deductions
- Finding which currency offers the best arbitrage spread at any moment

9. SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS
------------------------
- Add more stablecoins (BUSD, FRAX, TUSD, PYUSD)
- Add historical arbitrage spread charts (track opportunities over time)
- Add price alerts / notifications when spreads exceed a threshold
- Add more cryptocurrencies beyond BTC/ETH/SOL
- Add exchange-specific pricing (Binance vs Coinbase vs WazirX spreads)
- Consider upgrading to CoinGecko Pro API if rate limits become an issue
- Add portfolio tracker — input holdings, see total value and P&L
